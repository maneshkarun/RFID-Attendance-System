# RFID-Attendance-System
The basic idea behind this system is to use RFID tags or cards to track the attendance of individuals and to display the attendance data on a website.

The process works as follows:

- Read data from the RFID reader
- Identify the unique ID of the RFID tag or card
- Compare the ID with a database of authorized IDs
- Log the attendance data in a database
